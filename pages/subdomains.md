## Classification of activities in DDD
Identified functional areas can be prioritized using a Domain Driven Design approach in order to have a good understanding of priorities and assumptions for various subdomains.

### General domain
We could describe two main areas of activity:
* Farmacy Food - producing and selling healthy food
* Farmacy Family - engagement transactional customers

### Core subdomain
In core subdomain of Farmacy Family domain we identified:
* Engagement
* Customer facing mobile and web applications
* Rich user profile
* Data analysis and recommendations:
    * eDietician
    * Inventory Replenishment
    * Users Engagement Analysis

For core subdomain its better to be implemented in-house by our developer team because this area allows us to achieve an advantage over our competitors. 

### Generic subdomain
In generic subdomain we identified:
* Social network capabilities
* Webinars

These are the types of activities that all companies perform in the same way. We could buy the best solution on the market to close our requirements.


### Supporting subdomain
In supporting subdomain we identified:
* Authintication and authorisation
* Reporting 
* Notification 
* Tracing and Monitoring
* Integration with Farmacy Food system
* Integrations with 3rd party clinics

These activities just support the companyâ€™s business but do not provide any competitive advantage. Could be outsorced or implemented inhouse.
