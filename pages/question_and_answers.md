## Additional information based on Q&As

We have got some additional information during our Question and Answer session with the Product Owner:

* **Are there any cost limitations?** - Farmacy Food is a startup so we can assume infinite funding here, but no particular cost. Assume that there is no unlimited money

* **Can the medical data be attracted to the hackers?** - One thing is to create a threat profile. It's medical data.

* **Do we cover data center aspects as well?** - Yes, that is a set of concerns, because we have only transactional data in Farmacy Food and should think about analytical data in the new Farmacy Family architecture.

* **What about client UI?** - the only thing that we need to know, that Farmacy Food is a reactive application. We need to integrate with the reactive UI. Farmacy Food supports both mobile and web applications. You feel free to choose the solution.

* **Is the system global or country specific?** - you can safely keep this in the USA for now.

* **Are there any requirements for technologie stack?** - it's up to you as an architect.

* **Tell about the time for development** - you could offer your vision of evolution and roadmap and development process.

* **Are there any specific security issues? Are there any requirements for authentication, authorisation or cryptographic?** - Yes, medical data. Integration with clinics should be based only on permissions of customer allow.

* **Do we need to worry about CDN to have static content delivered sooner?** - It's not about requirements

* **What is the IT department of the pharmacy foods?** - It’s a startup

* **There are existing platforms that solve discussions/content/media staff well. Does FFo have a preference for build vs use existing solutions on that front? And why?** - We can't wait for your proposal. If you could find a solution with enough capabilities and integration points, it would be great.

* **Do we work with the assumption that pharmacy food is implemented on aws cloud? Do we have onprem resources?** - Farmacy Food is actually on AWS stack but noticed that we have new requirements here. Maybe we require something onprem for analytical data.

* **Do the diagrams need to be UML compliant or anything else could be correct?** - No need to be UML. Don't use tools that need downloading and installation processes for review.

* **Although users are primarily based out of the USA, is it expected that users with different languages are using the application?** - Multilingual or not - it's your decision.

* **Any particular format of ADRs of supporting documents that we should follow?** - No. Its free for you.

* **Do we have to integrate with pharmacy food identity?** - Farmacy Food and FFa should be integrated in case of sharing customer information. Interesting integration point.

* **Do we consider only web-based app or do we receive bonus points for mobile and flexibility on other devices/media?** - Existing Farmacy Food apps include web and mobile apps. The only requirement is to integrate your solution with Farmacy Food reactive applications

* **Could we advise some changes to the Farmacy Food solution?** - Yes if the Farmacy Family requires any modifications during integration, you could advise solutions. If you need customization of any service or interface of Farmacy Food you could do it.

* **How mature are the data science skills at Farmacy Food?** - We don’t have any employers with such skills, but they have access to that kind of expertise. That should not be an architectural restriction.

* **For integration with 3rd party systems can we assume any protocol such as REST or any other specific requirement?** - No specific requirements

* **Users based on Farmacy Food are across which geographies to incorporate latency aspect?** - all USA, not multinational. Farmacy Food is located in Michigan. Don’t need to build a new Facebook, we need strict clusterization of users by geographic areas.

* **Do we also consider iac and infrastructure automation, CI/CD etc?** - Not necessary, but you can consider the fitness function and specify it. And this could affect the CI/CD pipeline. That's not a core part of competition.

* **Do we have plans to deal with large objects (BLOBs like video, sound ets)?** - that should be a part of your architectural solution

* **Are farmacy food customers subscriptions based? Like monthly, yearly etc Would that change for farmacy family?** - Not now. I could be a real benefit of Farmacy Family
