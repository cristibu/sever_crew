#### ADR-1: Architecture design record style

**Date**
2021-10-23

**Status**
Accepted

**Context**
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

**Decision**
We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

**Consequences**
* We have a nice start to document our architectural solutions
* Maybe the structure of Michael Nygards ADR format could be not enough for some cases.
